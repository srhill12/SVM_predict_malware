# Predicting Malware with SVM

## Intro

I have trained a logistic regression model with malware data. I am going to to see if a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model can improve the accuracy.

## Steps

1. Prepare the data.

2. Model and fit the data to an SVM.

3. Predict the testing labels and calculate the performance metrics.

#### Prepare the Data

1. Load the [app-data.csv](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m13/lesson_1/datasets/app-data.csv) file into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Predict the `Result` variable.

3. Using the `app_data` DataFrame, separate the data into training and testing data. Start by defining the `y` (target) and `X` (features) of the data (all the columns except “Result”).

4. Split the features and target data into `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test` datasets by using the `train_test_split` function.

#### Model and Fit the Data to a Support Vector Machine

1. Declare a `SVC` model with a `kernel` value of `linear`.

2. Fit the training data to the model, and save the model.

3. Validate the model.

#### Predict the Testing Labels and Calculate the Performance Metrics

1. Make predictions about malware by using the testing dataset, and save those predictions.

2. Calculate the accuracy score by evaluating `y_test` vs. `testing_predictions`.

3. For this dataset, how well did the model predict actual malware? Is the accuracy improved on the logistic regression model?
